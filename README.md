# 🐾 Petmosphere – Where Pets Meet Their People!

Welcome to **Petmosphere**, the purr-fectly coded web platform made by sleep-deprived students with too much coffee and a love for furry friends. 🐶🐱

Developed for our **Integrative Programming** course, Petmosphere is built using **Laravel** and serves as an online hub where future pet parents can easily connect with their soon-to-be fur babies. It’s like Tinder, but for pets — and with fewer awkward first dates.

* 👤 **User Dashboards** – Create and manage accounts with ease.
* 💬 **Messaging System** – Chat directly with pet owners (no ghosting, please).

## 🎯 Mission

## ⚙️ How to Run This Baby 🛠️

Feeling brave enough to test it? Here's how:

1. `composer install` – Because Laravel doesn’t run on dreams alone.
2. `npm install` – For the cool front-end stuff.
3. Double-check your `.env` and `composer.json` (Laravel lives for config files).
4. `php artisan migrate` – Set up your database tables like a pro.
5. `php artisan serve` – Now we’re cooking!
6. Open **Postman** and go wild with testing! 🧪

## 💡 Team Notes

* We don’t bite, but our project does run best on a properly configured environment.
* Contributions from pets were minimal but moral support was strong. 🐕🐈
* Special thanks to caffeine and Laravel docs.
